# image_and_text_to_speech_converter-
Here in this website we will convert text and image to speech using speechsynthesisutterence,tesseract and web speech API. 

we have used bootstrap for home page and we have 2 sections in this website.
In the navbar in section 1 we have text to speech converter which has a textarea that converts text to speech through speechsynthesisutterence.
In the second section we have image to speech converter we have used tesseract.js to extract text from image and then we have converted extracted text into speech through speechsynthesisutterence in javascript.

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE INSTALLED NODE MODULES IN YOUR LAPTOP/PC AND INSTALLED TESSERACT.JS BY TYPING npm install tesseract.js in your terminal for image to speech conversion.
